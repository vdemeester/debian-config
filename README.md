Debian is the main GNU/Linux distribution I use ; on almost all my servers (at
home and at work) and on my laptops and desktops. Few of them uses Ubuntu
instead (mainly for testing).

> Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. 

This repository contains a set of tools and configuration for Debian and
derivatives. It aims to be used with [vcsh-home][] and [sh-config][]
repository at least.
